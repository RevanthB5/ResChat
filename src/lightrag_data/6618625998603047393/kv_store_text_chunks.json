    "content": "The emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) marks a significant milestone\nin the development of artificial intelligence. Insurance, as a vast and complex\ndiscipline, involves a wide variety of data forms in its operational processes,\nincluding text, images, and videos, thereby giving rise to diverse multimodal\ntasks. Despite this, there has been limited systematic exploration of\nmultimodal tasks specific to insurance, nor a thorough investigation into how\nLMMs can address these challenges. In this paper, we explore GPT-4V's\ncapabilities in the insurance domain. We categorize multimodal tasks by\nfocusing primarily on visual aspects based on types of insurance (e.g., auto,\nhousehold/commercial property, health, and agricultural insurance) and\ninsurance stages (e.g., risk assessment, risk monitoring, and claims\nprocessing). Our experiment reveals that GPT-4V exhibits remarkable abilities\nin insurance-related tasks, demonstrating not only a robust understanding of\nmultimodal content in the insurance domain but also a comprehensive knowledge\nof insurance scenarios. However, there are notable shortcomings: GPT-4V\nstruggles with detailed risk rating and loss assessment, suffers from\nhallucination in image understanding, and shows variable support for different\nlanguages. Through this work, we aim to bridge the insurance domain with\ncutting-edge LMM technology, facilitate interdisciplinary exchange and\ndevelopment, and provide a foundation for the continued advancement and\nevolution of future research endeavors.",
